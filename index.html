        <h1><strong>EMINƎM #1 Fanpage</strong></h1>
        <h1><p class='title'>Why Eminem is one of my favorite rappers of all time.</p></h1>
            <p class='samefontsize'>I have been an Eminem fan since I was around 5 years old. One of the very first songs I heard from him was,
                "My name is" and "The Real Slim Shady."
                I have always loved that even though he received a lot of critism, He never gave up what he loved to do.
                Even from his own mother who he says use to feed him pills and abuse him.
            </p>
        <h2><p class='title'>Why Eminem is one of the greatest rappers.</p></h2>

            <li><p class='styleFont'>Em sold a total of 3 million albums from an album that did not preform as expected. As compared to one of his earlier albums "The Eminem Show," Which sold over 33 million.</p></li>
